# 3.0.0

## Added

- Added a read-only **Forge health** layout for Obsidian Bases.
- Added cached health grouping for errors, warnings, notes needing review, clean notes, and notes not included in the latest scan.
- Added Bases view controls for minimum severity, clean and unscanned visibility, and grouping by health status.
- Added native file opening, modifier-click, and hover-preview behavior to Forge health rows.
- Added an installed workflow guide for the Forge Health Bases view.

## Changed

- Raised `minAppVersion` to `1.10.0` and the Forge major version to `3.0.0` because Bases is now a first-class plugin surface.
- Registered the Bases view directly against the guaranteed Obsidian 1.10 API.
- Extended cached lint and Shape results with scanned file paths so clean and unscanned notes can be distinguished without writing health metadata into notes.
- Kept Base query updates read-only and cache-backed; changing Base filters or properties does not start a vault scan.
- Replaced settings-file polling with Obsidian's native external-settings callback.
- Preserved the explicit Vault Health reload prompt when synced settings differ, without silently replacing active settings.
- Added native declarative settings controls, individual settings search, and inline validation support on Obsidian 1.13+, with the existing renderer retained for Obsidian 1.10–1.12.

## Compatibility

- Forge 3 requires Obsidian `1.10.0` or newer.
- The Bases core plugin must be enabled for the Forge health layout to appear.
- No note or settings migration is required.
- Run **Reload plugins** after updating so Obsidian registers the new Bases layout.
- Refresh Forge health once after upgrading to populate clean-versus-unscanned cache data; findings from older caches remain visible.

---

# 2.0.5

## Fixed

- Added declarative settings definitions so Forge settings can appear in Obsidian 1.13+ settings search while preserving the legacy settings renderer for older Obsidian versions.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No manual migration is required.
- Users on Obsidian versions before `1.13.0` continue to use the existing settings tab renderer.

---

# 2.0.4

## Fixed

- Reworked repair issue collection to avoid the remaining unsafe `any`/`error`-typed value warnings reported by Obsidian source review.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No manual migration is required.
- No user-facing behavior changed.

---

# 2.0.3

## Fixed

- Reworked dashboard inventory, workspace normalization, repair operation, and active-file lint helper code to avoid unsafe `any`/`error`-typed values flagged by Obsidian source review.
- Removed an unnecessary type assertion in active-file lint pruning without relying on unsafe iterator values.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No manual migration is required.

---

# 2.0.2

## Fixed

- Fixed broad ESLint/source-review scans by ignoring generated test output, test files, and build-support scripts that are outside the Obsidian plugin runtime.
- Updated `lint:obsidian` to run the same broad ESLint entry point used by external source review, while keeping tests covered by `npm test`.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No manual migration is required.

---

# 2.0.1

## Note

- Sorry for pushing 2.0.0 before the Obsidian-only refactor was actually finished. This release completes that cleanup.

## Changed

- Removed the old host-independent `forge-core` package from the active plugin architecture.
- Folded the former core code into normal Obsidian plugin modules organized by responsibility: config, vault access, linting, schemas, dashboard, patching, repairs, shapes, exports, docs install, ontology, and app UI.
- Kept Forge source organized in focused folders rather than flattening `src/` into one large directory.
- Rebuilt imports, tests, and build configuration around local Obsidian plugin modules instead of `@forge/core`.
- Updated installed release assets for desktop and mobile test vault validation.

## Fixed

- Removed remaining package and lockfile wiring that could make the Obsidian plugin consume the old local `forge-core` package.
- Preserved existing settings compatibility while finishing the architecture cleanup.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No manual migration is required.

---

# 2.0.0

## Added

- Added a compact desktop-only Forge status bar item with current health, dashboard open, and quick actions for refresh, lint, schema validation, shape lint, and settings.
- Added the `Overview`, `Note`, `Issues`, and `Tools` Vault Health dashboard tabs.
- Added dashboard inventory as an optional setting for counting vault file types and non-note assets.
- Added a dashboard refresh exports setting so generated exports can be refreshed during dashboard refresh only when users opt in.
- Added an empty-heading allowance setting for vaults that intentionally use heading-only structures, nested headings without prose, or Dataview/table-first sections.
- Added Shape Repair to dashboard cleanup actions when Shape Repair is enabled.
- Added automated integration coverage for dashboard model behavior used by the Obsidian plugin.

## Changed

- Reworked Vault Health into a clearer dashboard:
  - `Overview` shows Health Summary, Recommendations, optional Vault Inventory, and Ontology.
  - `Note` focuses on the active note's Lint, Shape, and Needs Review state.
  - `Issues` shows active lint issues, Shape Health, and Needs Review.
  - `Tools` contains grouped actions, Schema Health, Lockblock, and Maintenance History.
- Grouped dashboard actions into Checks, Cleanup, and Outputs so destructive, scanning, and output actions are easier to distinguish.
- Moved schema validation back into Schema Health so the schema status and its refresh action live together.
- Made Shape Health use the same grouped issue format as Active Issues.
- Made dashboard refresh run schema validation, optional pre-scan maintenance, vault lint, shape lint, optional exports, ontology metrics, optional post-output maintenance, patch history, and snapshot composition in dependency order so one refresh produces complete output.
- Turned dashboard inventory and dashboard-triggered exports off by default to reduce baseline refresh cost.
- Made Refresh metrics update ontology metrics and, when dashboard inventory is enabled, file inventory without requiring exports.
- Hid Vault Inventory when inventory is disabled instead of showing an empty placeholder.
- Hid shape actions when the relevant Shape Engine features are disabled.
- Hid export and Dataview expansion actions when their settings or dependencies are disabled.
- Improved mobile and narrow-sidebar layout for dashboard tabs, action controls, issue rows, and Open buttons.
- Removed the restored legacy upgrade guide from plugin output and simplified the old migration notice.
- Began moving lint, repair, patch, dashboard, export, schema, settings, and shape logic into reusable internal modules.

## Performance

- Reduced default dashboard refresh work by making inventory and export refresh optional.
- Avoided running expensive inventory scans unless dashboard inventory is enabled.
- Kept status bar health display snapshot-driven so it does not trigger vault scans just to update the status bar.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No manual migration is required.
- If you relied on dashboard refresh regenerating exports, enable dashboard refresh exports in Forge settings.

---

# 1.10.5

## Fixed

- Enum validation now accepts YAML list values when every item is in the field's allowed enum values.
- `exempt_paths` now supports glob patterns such as `**/_*.md` and `**/*.excalidraw.md` for recurring filename exclusions across folders.
- Changing the schema note or version settings now reloads schema-backed settings immediately and updates the dashboard schema path without switching tabs or running validation first.
- The Lint tab now shows the full schema note path directly so same-named schema files do not look unchanged after save.

## Added

- Added a Reload schema action on the Lint settings tab.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.10.4

## Changed

- Forge settings summaries now use clearer labels and avoid duplicate summary boxes in sections that already match the active tab summary.

- The Lint tab now keeps the schema note summary and setting row compact while preserving the full schema path on demand.
- Export, patch, shape, and folder picker path settings now reuse the same compact path display pattern where appropriate.
- Summary cards now use compact status-dot styling and mobile-friendly wrapping.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.10.3

## Added

- Added richer Vault Lint and Shape Lint result modals with summary cards, severity filters, grouped findings, report links, and per-file open actions.
- Added Vault Health dashboard action running states so long-running dashboard commands show progress and temporarily disable competing actions.
- Added theme-overridable destructive action styling for Vault Health dashboard actions that mutate vault content or generated operational files.

## Changed

- Vault Health now preserves scroll position during refreshes, exports, lint runs, and other dashboard actions.
- Vault Health now consolidates Shape Health into a single section and keeps current-note shape details inside the Current Note panel.
- Vault Health now gives primary, secondary, and destructive actions clearer visual hierarchy.
- Forge settings now refresh dependent sub-settings immediately while preserving scroll position.
- Forge settings now show compact tab and section summaries for the active configuration.
- Shape Lint results now share the same results-modal pattern as Vault Lint.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.10.2

## Changed

- Vault Health now keeps the Health Summary quieter by hiding Invalid frontmatter when there are no invalid-frontmatter findings.

- Vault Health now shows review backlog count in the header pill and renders review items in a dedicated Needs Review section.
- Current Note now includes a Needs Review flag and details inside the existing current-note panel.
- Settings and bundled docs now describe stale inbox handling as Needs Review instead of lint warnings.
- Legacy inbox retention action `warning` is now migrated to canonical `review` during settings load.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- Existing inbox retention settings are preserved. The legacy stored action value `warning` is treated as `review` and saved forward.
- No user migration is required.

---

# 1.10.0

## Added

- Added operation-level patch scopes so any patch operation can narrow matched files before it runs.
- Added frontmatter date scopes: `updated_since`, `updated_before`, `created_since`, `created_before`, and `updated_field`.
- Added filesystem date scopes: `file_modified_since`, `file_modified_before`, `file_created_since`, and `file_created_before`.
- Added predicate scopes for frontmatter fields, tags, paths, common `type`/`status` matching, and a scoped `limit`.

## Changed

- Applied patch notes are now copied into the `Applied` folder instead of moved, so reusable patch notes can stay in place.
- Patch Engine documentation and examples now describe scoped targets using generic, non-identifying examples.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- Existing patches continue to work without changes.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.9.1

## Changed

- Added right-aligned value labels to Forge settings sliders, matching the Lockblock settings pattern.
- Converted Dataview Expansion auto-update delay from a text input to a `0-60s` slider with a live value label.
- Slider value labels now update while dragging.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.9.0

## Added

- Added `Apply patch from patches folder` so any patch note under the configured patches folder can be applied without changing the default patch file setting.

## Changed

- Patch picker lists Markdown patch notes under the configured patches folder.
- Generated patch operation folders are excluded from the picker: `Applied`, `Backups`, and `Reports`.
- Selected patch notes reuse the existing dry-run, confirmation, apply, report, archive, manifest, and auto-lint flow.
- Picker-launched patch runs now surface async errors with a Forge notice instead of failing silently.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.8.6

## Changed

- Updated Vault Health Lockblock controls to use Lockblock's public lock-state API when available.
- The Lockblock dashboard section now shows only the relevant action for the current state: setup, unlock, or lock.
- The Lockblock dashboard status badge now reflects `Not set up`, `Locked`, or `Unlocked` when Lockblock exposes that state.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- Lockblock state-aware controls require a Lockblock build that exposes `getVaultLockState()`; Forge falls back to the previous generic controls if state is unavailable.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.8.5

## Changed

- Added `data-status` to Vault Health dashboard section title elements so themes can color section headings by their real health state without matching visible text.
- Kept existing Vault Health section, section header, and status badge CSS variable behavior for good, warning, critical, and muted states.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.8.4

## Changed

- Updated the Vault Health dashboard heading hierarchy: the dashboard title is now an `h1`, and section titles are now `h2`.
- Standardized Vault Health dashboard naming to Title Case across the dashboard title, commands, notices, and settings copy.
- Kept Vault Health dashboard status coloring tied to the header `data-status` attribute so the title follows the same health state as the dashboard pill and sections.
- Disabled the Obsidian sentence-case lint rule so Forge can keep its Title Case UI convention while retaining the rest of the Obsidian lint checks.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.8.3

## Fixed

- Removed unsafe TypeScript patterns flagged by Obsidian source review in YAML serialization, dataview fence trimming, ontology sorting, and frontmatter write paths.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.8.2

## Fixed

- Tightened Forge Health dashboard spacing in narrow panes, including compact Maintenance History key/value rows, intentional odd metric-card spanning, and consistent gaps around action rows, issue groups, metrics, and tables.
- Scoped stronger Forge Health button and toggle sizing rules so theme styles cannot inflate dashboard controls or make action rows overflow.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.8.1

## Fixed

- Removed deprecated `setDynamicTooltip()` calls from Forge settings sliders so Obsidian source-code review no longer flags the slider API.
- Added spacing below the Shape Health no-issues message so action buttons do not crowd the status text on mobile.
- Replaced remaining Forge-specific issue severity classes with `data-severity` attributes styled through Obsidian semantic text variables.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.8.0

## Changed

- Forge Health dashboard styling now adapts through standard Obsidian theme variables instead of Forge-specific theme overrides.
- Dashboard status colors now use semantic state attributes and Obsidian text tokens for good, warning, critical, and muted states.
- Dashboard surfaces, borders, hover states, controls, metrics, tables, and chips now avoid fixed Forge color assumptions.
- Improved mobile dashboard spacing so content is less likely to sit behind floating Obsidian navigation.
- Improved dashboard table padding, line-height, and button wrapping for narrow panes.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.7.0

## Added

- Added a Lockblock section to the Forge health dashboard when Lockblock is installed and enabled.

- The Lockblock dashboard section now appears or disappears automatically when Lockblock is enabled or disabled.
- Dataview Expansion dashboard controls now appear or disappear automatically when Dataview is enabled or disabled.

## Changed

- Forge now calls Lockblock's exact command IDs for those actions so unlock, lock, and password changes remain distinct.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.6.10

## Changed

- Current Note now shows `Exempt` in a muted status pill when note-level lint skips the file because it matches Forge exempt paths.
- Exempt current notes no longer appear as `Clear` or show the no-issues message in the dashboard.

## Compatibility

- `minAppVersion` remains `1.7.2`.
- No migration is required.

---

# 1.6.9

## Changed

- Active-file auto-lint waits 10 seconds after typing stops by default.
- Dataview Expansion auto-update delay is now configurable in seconds instead of being fixed at 5 seconds.
- Auto-lint now shows a small failure notice with the note name and error or warning counts when the current note fails lint.
- Single-file linting now reuses the existing lint engine without replacing full-vault lint for dashboard and report workflows.
- Fixed the remaining Obsidian Community Plugins sentence-case lint issue in the new active-file lint settings copy.

---

# 1.6.6 & 1.6.7

## Changed

- Fixed the remaining local Community Plugins review-linter findings across commands, settings, dashboard views, and utility code.
- Standardized command names, modal titles, button labels, and notices to sentence case for Community Plugins UI consistency.

- Dataview Expansion still targets fenced `dataview` blocks only; `dataviewjs` is not included.
- No user migration is required.

---

# 1.6.2

## Changed

- Dataview Expansion auto-update now uses `Off` or `Edit idle` mode instead of the earlier save-based toggle.
- `Edit idle` waits 5 seconds after typing stops and also refreshes when you leave the note, avoiding refresh-on-every-write behavior in live editing.

## Compatibility

- Existing Dataview Expansion settings remain supported.
- Older saved `auto-update on save` values migrate automatically to the new auto-update mode.
- No user migration is required.

---

# 1.6.1

## Fixed

- Repaired stale internal wiki-links in the bundled docs, including outdated export and Shapes note references.
- Fixed docs-to-examples handoffs so key onboarding pages link directly to the installed starter schema and practical example notes.

- Live settings reload path for externally changed plugin settings.

## Changed

- Forge now watches synced `data.json` changes and offers an in-panel reload instead of requiring a Community Plugins refresh.

- No user migration is required.

---

# 1.5.4

## Added

- Maintenance setting for inbox retention action.

## Changed

- Inbox retention can now either delete stale inbox notes during maintenance or leave them for Vault Lint to report.

## Compatibility

- Existing inbox retention day settings are preserved.
- The default inbox retention action is delete during maintenance, so existing behavior is unchanged until the setting is updated.
- No user migration is required.

---

# 1.5.3

## Changed

- Shape Lint now treats non-empty descendant sections as satisfying a parent section, so flexible container headings do not trigger empty-section findings.

## Compatibility

- Existing shapes and templates are preserved.
- No user migration is required.

---

# 1.5.2

## Added

- Optional inbox-folder exclusion for Vault Lint.
- Optional inbox-folder exclusion for Shape Lint.

## Changed

- Patch manifests now write `manifest_version: 2` and preserve legacy `changes` backup entries while adding an `operations` array.
- New patch applies no longer create full-file `.bak` backups for operation-manifest restore.
- Restore Patch Run keeps legacy full-file restore fallback for old manifests, but labels it clearly as full-file backup restore.
- Patch history can surface changed operation counts from v2 manifests.

## Safety

- Operation-level restore only reverses an operation when the current value still matches the value written by the original patch.
- Conflicted operations are skipped by default to preserve unrelated edits made after patch apply.

---

# 1.1.0

## Added

- Vault Health Dashboard custom Obsidian view with manual refresh, cached results, summary metrics, schema health, active lint issue listing, ontology metrics, maintenance history, and section-level health indicators.
- Dashboard service/cache layer backed by `System/Forge/health-dashboard.json`.

---

# 1.0.0

## Breaking Changes

Schema structure has changed completely in this release. Existing `schema.md` files using the previous contract will not be read by Forge. Migration is required before upgrading.

See the Schema Reference documentation for the complete 1.0.0 contract structure.

### Schema contract restructured

The following top-level keys have been removed:

- `required_fields`
- `optional_fields`
- `inline_fields`
- `meta`

The following top-level keys are now required:

- `frontmatter` — with `required` and `optional` sublists
- `inline` — with an `allowed` list
- `ontology` — with a `relationships` map
- `tag_rules`
- `exempt_paths`

### `inline_fields` replaced by `inline.allowed`

The flat `inline_fields` list is replaced by `inline.allowed`. Each entry is now an object with at minimum `name`. Entries may also carry `required_when` and `severity` for conditional validation.

### `required_fields` / `optional_fields` replaced by `frontmatter`

Field contracts now live under `frontmatter.required` and `frontmatter.optional`. The structure of each field entry is unchanged.

### `meta` block removed

The `meta` block is no longer read by Forge. Version is now read from an inline field or frontmatter field configured in Settings → Lint. The block may remain in your schema note — Forge does not validate or reject extra keys.

---

## Added

### Schema

- `inline.allowed` entries support `required_when` — conditional inline field requirements scoped to specific note types via `field` and `values` keys
- `tag_rules.forbidden_namespaces` — explicitly reserved strings that must not be used as tag namespaces; violations are always `error` severity regardless of strict mode
- `review_cycle` field supports `values_meta` — each enum value can carry a `days` count that Forge uses for stale review calculations; replaces the internal hardcoded day map
- `biweekly` (14 days) and `semiannual` (182 days) added to the recommended `review_cycle` enum values
- `ontology.relationships` is the canonical source for all relationship definitions — `description`, `direction`, `allowed_between` / `sources` / `targets`, and `template_heading` per relationship

### Settings — Lint tab

- **Version field location** — choose whether the schema version lives in inline metadata or frontmatter
- **Version field** — schema-driven dropdown populated from the chosen location; defaults to `version` inline
- **Repair prompt threshold** — choose when the Open Vault Repair button appears after lint: errors only (default) or errors and warnings

### Settings — Shapes tab

- **Inject relationship headings from schema** — when enabled, template refinement injects relationship headings into generated templates based on `ontology.relationships`
- **Relationship parent heading** — configurable parent heading name; defaults to `Related`
- **Relationship heading level** — H1, H2, or H3 for the parent heading; subheadings are always one level below; defaults to H1
- **Relationship injection position** — Append (add section at end) or Inject (add missing headings under existing parent, falls back to append)

### Lint engine

- `forbidden_namespace` — new lint rule; fires when a tag uses a namespace in `tag_rules.forbidden_namespaces`; always `error` severity
- `required_when` — inline field conditional requirement rule; fires when a frontmatter field matches a configured value and the inline field is absent
- Stale review day counts now read from `review_cycle.values_meta` in schema instead of a hardcoded internal map; adding or removing cycle values in schema automatically updates stale review behavior

### Vault Repair

- **Write & Open Patch** button — writes the repair patch and immediately opens it in the editor
- Repair now includes warning-severity results when threshold is set to errors and warnings; repairable warning rules: `required_field`, `type_mismatch`, `enum_value`, `date_format`, `required_when`, `no_frontmatter`, `tag_namespace`, `unknown_tag_namespace`, `forbidden_namespace`, `stale_date`

### Template Refinement

- Relationship headings injected from schema include the relationship `description` as body text under each subheading

### Upgrade notice

- Users upgrading from a previous installation see a one-time migration notice on first load summarising the schema contract changes; fresh installs are unaffected

---

## Changed

- Validate Schema now performs recursive structural validation — each section and subsection is checked against the expected contract shape; ontology relationship entries are only validated when `shapeLintEnabled` or `exportEnabled` is on
- Validate Schema is now settings-aware — passes active settings to structural validation so feature-gated sections are only checked when the relevant feature is enabled
- Schema cache helpers updated to use new schema structure: `getFrontmatterFieldNames`, `getEnumFieldNames`, `getEnumValues`, `getFieldType`, `getInlineFieldNames`, `getFieldNamesByLocation`
- `inline_undocumented` lint message updated to reference `inline.allowed` instead of `inline_fields`
- All field pointer settings in the settings tab render as schema-driven dropdowns rather than free-text inputs
- Export commands read `schema.version` directly rather than `schema.meta.version`

---

## Removed

- Hardcoded `CYCLE_DAYS` constant in lint engine — replaced by `review_cycle.values_meta` traversal
- `lint_output` and `patch_engine` keys removed from `VaultSchema` TypeScript interface — these were unused and not present in schema
- `SchemaMeta` interface removed
- Legacy schema key detection removed — Forge does not attempt to read or migrate the previous schema structure

# 0.9.0

## Added

- **Recursive documentation and examples install support** — bundled `docs/` and `examples/` content can now be organized into subfolders and installed into the matching vault structure under the configured Forge folders
- **Complete vault-installed documentation set** — added a redesigned documentation tree covering getting started, folder layout, commands, schema reference, vault lint, patch engine, docs installer, maintenance, settings, troubleshooting, exports, ontology indexes, normalization, vault repair, Shapes, Shape lint, Shape repair, and Shape versioning roadmap guidance
- **Complete examples structure** — added organized example packs for starter schemas, lint cleanup, patch workflows, repair workflows, exports, Shapes, and maintenance routines
- **Screenshot asset set** — added a canonical documentation/wiki screenshot set under `assets/screenshots/` with stable raw GitHub embed filenames
- **Relationship index documentation** — expanded ontology/export documentation with user-facing explanations of how relationship indexes help navigation, dashboards, AI workflows, Dataview, and Bases
- **Docs installer reference** — added documentation for install targets, placeholder substitution, subfolder preservation, no-overwrite behavior, and generated frontmatter handling
- **Shape workflow documentation** — added dedicated guides for Shapes overview, template refinement, Shape lint, Shape repair, and practical Shape versioning conventions

## Changed

- Reworked README positioning from infrastructure-heavy "vault governance" language toward broader vault consistency, reliability, Dataview/Bases support, and approachable long-term maintenance
- Restructured bundled docs and examples from flat files into ordered subfolders with `1.`, `2.`, etc. filename prefixes where reading order matters
- Updated docs to avoid top-level H1 title duplication where Obsidian already displays the note title; section headings now start at `#` inside those notes
- Replaced deprecated screenshot references with the finalized asset filenames
- Reframed ontology documentation as practical relationship indexes so the feature is understandable to non-specialist Obsidian users
- Updated manual installation guidance to tell users to click **Reload plugins** after install or update

## Removed

- Removed references to obsolete flat documentation files
- Removed or replaced deprecated screenshot names
