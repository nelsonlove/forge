/**
 * One heading scanner, shared by every caller that needs to know where a note's
 * headings are.
 *
 * A `#` at the start of a line is not always a heading. Markdown says a fenced code
 * block is opaque, and Obsidian says a `%%` comment is invisible. Scanning line by line
 * with a bare regex ignores both, so a shell comment in a code block becomes an H1, and
 * Forge then treats it as a document section: it can be matched by a template node,
 * counted as an extra heading, or used as a boundary when Shape Repair decides where to
 * insert. Measured on one real vault, 59 notes had at least one heading-shaped line
 * inside a fence.
 *
 * The rules here are CommonMark's for fences and Obsidian's for comments:
 *
 *   - A fence opens on three or more backticks or tildes and closes on a run of the same
 *     character at least as long. A shorter run inside a longer fence is content, which
 *     is how a markdown example shows fenced code without ending its own block.
 *   - A closing fence carries no info string, so ```md opens and a bare ``` closes.
 *   - `%%` toggles an Obsidian comment. A line holding a complete `%% ... %%` comment
 *     stays balanced; an odd marker opens a block that runs to the next marker.
